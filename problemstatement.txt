
We have used antd form component. In that have used add fields feature to add the same 2 dropdowns for the second switch board.
But while clicking on add button by default the size of second switch board is set as per the 1st switchboard size. When we change the
value for second switchboard, 1st switchboard size also changes.
What we want is if we click on add button the frame size shoud not change. it should be independent from one another.
